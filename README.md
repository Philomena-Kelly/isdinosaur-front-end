# IsDinosaur Frontend
*Click **[here](https://github.com/Philomena-Kelly/isdinosaur-back-end)** for backend.*
<br>

A micro web-app that accepts a user search term and returns an answer if what is searched is a dinosaur or note.

> *Note, this currently checks if Wikipedia specifies the creature under the clade **Dinosauria** and links to the dinosaur Wikipedia page in the biobox. Given this, it only returns true for prehistoric dinosaurs.*

Created using React framework.

## Future Plans:
* Adding features to count amount of successful searches.
* Creating some kind of algorithm that will collect descriptions of searched terms, compare to a database of known dinosaurs, and return a dinosaur that has similar characteristics.
